This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## About the project

This was a summer coding project under the SMU HEAP Summer Programme by SMU .hack. We did the project in year 1 with limited coding experience in JS, TS and Web Application Development in general, and it was a avenue for us to learn fullstack Web Application Development.

The idea of the website (thryft) was derived from a need to centralise the platform in which thrift/curated vintage stores could post their listings. Our group had the problem statement that these stores and sellers were on too many different platforms to sell their clothings (eg. Telegram, Instagram, Tiktok or Physical Store Locations), and having a "go-to" website would streamline the search process for our target demographic (Young Adults who are into thrifting/curated clothing) to purchase and discover these items. The website is mainly inspired by platforms such as Carousell and Grailed, with our main emphasis being having a multi-vendor e-commerce platform where anyone could set up a page and start selling their clothing.

## Deployment

Website can be deployed via vercel, however do take note that the image uploading feature does not work on preview/prod builds due to the nature of vercel and security implemented by default on vercel.
